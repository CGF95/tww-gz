The Wind Waker (SD) ROM hack to practice speedrunning.

This Practice ROM is in very early development. If you've come across this page (somehow) prior to the first release and are looking for a workable practice ROM
please use "tww.zip" pinned in the "Rom hacks" channel in the wind waker speedrun discord https://discord.gg/Sj5aehU

This practice rom requires the NTSC-J ISO to run (GZLJ-01)

You MUST name your iso GZLJ01.iso or the script will not work to read and patch your iso.
